# Disease Prediction Web App

A **Flask-based Machine Learning web application** that predicts possible diseases based on the symptoms entered by the user.  
The system also provides **disease descriptions, precautions, medications, diet suggestions, and recommended workouts** to help users understand their condition better.

---

## Features

- Predict disease from given symptoms using a pre-trained ML model  
- Provides detailed disease **description**  
- Suggests suitable **medications** and **precautions**  
- Recommends healthy **diet plans**  
- Suggests relevant **workouts**  
- Interactive and simple **Flask web interface**

## Installation and Setup

Follow the steps below to run the project locally:

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dhivya-ramasamy123/Personalized_Medicine_prediction.git
cd Personalized_Medicine_prediction
```

### 2️⃣ Create and activate a virtual environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
# OR
source venv/bin/activate  # On Mac/Linux
```

### 3️⃣ Install dependencies
pip install flask numpy pandas scikit-learn

### 4️⃣ Run the Flask app
```bash
python app.py
```

### 5️⃣ Open in your browser  
Visit **http://127.0.0.1:5000/** to use the web app.

## How It Works

1. The user enters symptoms (comma-separated) — e.g.  
   ```
   itching, skin_rash, fatigue
   ```
2. The app converts the symptoms into a binary vector using a symptom dictionary.
3. The trained **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)** model predicts the disease.
4. The helper function retrieves:
   - Disease description  
   - Precautions  
   - Medications  
   - Diet recommendations  
   - Workouts
5. The results are displayed on the web page.

## Machine Learning Model

- **Model Used:** Support Vector Classifier (SVC)  
- **Framework:** scikit-learn  
- **Input:** Binary vector of 132 symptoms  
- **Output:** Predicted disease label (e.g., Diabetes, Dengue, Malaria, etc.)
